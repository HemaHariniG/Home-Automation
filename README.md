# Home-Automation
Maven Silicon- Embedded System Project

The goal of this project is to create and execute a comprehensive Home 
Automation system that will allow users to remotely monitor and control many 
aspects of their home environment. This includes automatic lighting, temperature 
control, appliance management. The system is intended to be user-friendly, 
scalable, and adaptable to various residential environments.

Scenario Application  
1.Automated Lighting Control 
Automation of lighting is a major factor in increasing energy efficiency and 
convenience in a smart home setting. Using motion and light sensors, our home 
automation system automatically modifies the lighting according to occupancy and 
ambient light levels. For example, the motion sensor in a room recognizes the 
presence of a person and turns on the lights. In contrast, the lights are switched off 
to save energy when the room is empty. To ensure ideal illumination at all times, it 
can be improvised with light sensors that also modify the lights' intensity in 
response to the availability of natural light. 
 
 
2.Automated fan keeping Temperature in Control 
Keeping the inside temperature at a comfortable level is necessary for a 
comfortable living space. To control heating and cooling systems, our system 
incorporates temperature sensors. The Fan will automatically adapt to maintain the 
desired temperature ranges that users have chosen. This not only guarantees 
comfort but also contributes to energy conservation by preventing needless heating 
or cooling of the house while it is unoccupied 
 
3. Automated and Manual mode 
Our home automation system's remote control and environment monitoring 
capabilities are among its main benefits. Users can access all system functionalities 
from their smartphones or tablets by using a dedicated mobile application. This 
includes monitoring live video feeds, controlling the temperature, turning on and 
off lights, and getting security warnings. With remote access, homeowners may 
control their home environment from anywhere in the world, which adds 
convenience and peace of mind. 
 
Functional requirements 
• This project controls two home appliances, a light bulb and a fan connected to a 
230V supply through relays. 
• The controller board is connected to the home WiFi network. 
• The fan and bulb are controlled by a mobile connected to home WiFi network. 
• Auto or mobile control mode can be selected on the mobile phone. 

Non-Functional requirements 

Performance requirements: 
    Automatic mode: 
➢ bulb should switch on after the entry of human in the room within 1 minute. 
➢ Fan should switch on as soon as the threshold is detected within 1 minute. 
  
 
 Manual control mode: 
➢ The bulb should switch on within 1 minute of pressing the button on the 
mobile phone. 
➢ Fan should switch on within 1 minute of pressing the button on the mobile 
phone. 
Environment requirements: 
➢ The system should work in the temperature range 0 degree centigrade to 60 
degree centigrade.
